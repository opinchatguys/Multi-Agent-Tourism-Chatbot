Project Summary

My approach
- Built a coordinator `parent_tourism_agent` that interprets free‑text input with `parse_user_query`, then routes to live APIs: `get_coordinates` (Nominatim), `get_weather` (Open‑Meteo), and `get_tourist_places` (Overpass). No LLM knowledge for facts.
- Enforced real API usage; all outputs are derived from live endpoints.
- Executed child agents in parallel (weather + places) with timeouts, retries, and a simple circuit breaker for resilience.
- Returned a friendly, structured response: natural‑language weather summary plus bullet‑listed attractions.

Key decisions
- Used LangChain to enable clean orchestration and future extensibility around tools and agents.
- Selected reliable, free APIs: Nominatim for geocoding, Open‑Meteo for weather, Overpass (OpenStreetMap) for tourist places.
- Implemented geocoding first, as lat/lon is the shared prerequisite for both child agents.
- Chose Gradio for a friction‑free web UI and straightforward deployment to Hugging Face Spaces.
- Managed configuration via environment variables (User‑Agent strings), avoiding hardcoded secrets.

Challenges
- Crafting a correct Overpass QL query for tourism=attraction within a 20km radius and parsing heterogeneous OSM tags to extract place names.
- Handling API rate limits and Nominatim’s User‑Agent requirements; ensuring geocoding failures return “I don't think this place exists.” instead of raw exceptions.
- Aligning precipitation probability to the current time slot and keeping outputs clear and consistent.

Workflow (end‑to‑end)
- User enters a query (e.g., “I’m going to Bangalore!”).
- `parse_user_query` infers intent (“weather”, “places”, or both) and extracts destination text.
- `get_coordinates` resolves destination → lat/lon via Nominatim; on failure, immediately respond with “I don't think this place exists.”
- In parallel (for “both”): `get_weather` fetches current temperature and rain probability; `get_tourist_places` fetches up to 5 nearby attractions via Overpass.
- Results are compiled and formatted:
  - Weather: “24°C with a chance of 35% to rain.”
  - Places: bullet list of attractions.
- Final response is returned via the Gradio UI.

Deployment
- Gradio interface wraps `parent_tourism_agent`, exposing one textbox for input and a response area.
- Ready for Hugging Face Spaces: install dependencies, set `NOMINATIM_USER_AGENT` and `OVERPASS_USER_AGENT`, run the Gradio app to serve the UI.
